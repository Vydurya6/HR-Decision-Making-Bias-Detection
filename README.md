# HR-Decision-Making-Bias-Detection
This repository contains the complete source code and additional resources for my master's dissertation project on "Algorithmic Bias and Fairness in HR Decision-Making." The project explores the application of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to detect and mitigate biases in HR decision-making processes. It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, along with visualizations and a comprehensive analysis of the results. The goal is to contribute to the development of fairer AI tools in human resources management, ensuring equitable treatment of all job candidates.
